# Pokedex App

## Description

This Javacript app is a simple Pokedex, deiplaying a list of pok√©mon on a webpage, and, on click, providing further details in a modal. You can find the page on [GitHub](https://darisam.github.io/Pokedex/index.html).

## Purpose

The app was created to get familiar with Javascript in general and with AJAX and the handling of modals specifically.

## Details 

The script is plain Javascript and conforms to ES6 standard. The data are loaded from [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/RESTful), a RESTful API. Bootstrap was used to create the page to diplay the app, which in turn makes use of jQuery and SASS. The necessary files are provided via the jsDelivr CDN and jQuery CDN.
